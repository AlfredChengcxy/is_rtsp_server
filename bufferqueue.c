 * @defgroup bufferqueue Buffer Queue
 *
 * @brief Producer/consumer buffer queue structure
 *
 * The buffer queue is a data structure that allows one producer
 * (i.e.: a demuxer) to read data and feed it to multiple consumers
 * (i.e.: the RTSP clients).
 *
 * The structure is implemented in a very simple way: there is one big
 * double-ended queue for each producer, the elements of this queue
 * are wrappers around the actual buffer structures. Each time the
 * producer reads a buffer, it is added to its queue, with a “seen
 * count” of zero.
 *
 * Each consumer gets, at any time, the pointer to the start of the
 * queue and as it moves on to the following element, the “seen count”
 * gets incremented. Once the seen count reaches the amount of
 * consumers, the element is deleted from the queue.
 *
 * @{

/**
 * @brief Producer structure
 *
 * This is the structure that keeps all the information related to the
 * buffer queue producer. Which means the main lock for the queue and
 * the queue itself, as well as the eventual functions to call for
 * events and the consumers count.
